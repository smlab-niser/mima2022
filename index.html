		<b>Abstract:</b> Abstract: Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium lining of a woman's uterus. The average age when girls start menstruating is around the age of 12 years (menarche), and the cycle continues until they attain menopause (about the age of 51). Medical research and analysis in this field reveal that most women have to go through a painful cycle of abdominal cramps along with sanitary pad rashes while painkillers or endurance ability is their go-to solution. Heat pads or hot water bags also help in pain reduction. Currently, the concept of period pants revolves around pad-free and hassle-free periods for women whereas most women still prefer sanitary pads during their period cycle. MIMA aims at the development of IoT integrated smart functional intimate wear for women that would help women comfort during menstruation by catering to issues of menstrual cramps, rashes, leakage and stains, malodor, etc. The proposed methodology has been implemented referring to the online survey conducted from Indian women (17- 58 years old). The proposed intimate wear- MIMA can provide comfort during the menstruation cycle with IoT integrated Heat-Pad and functional alterations in the garment for a rash-free, anti-odor, and leak-proof period. <br>

	<div id="caption-2" style="display:none;">
		<p>MIMA revolves around the concept of Menstruation i.e. the monthly shedding of the endometrium of the female uterus and the problems associated with it.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="caption-10" style="display:none;">
		<p>The IoT system of MIMA was designed to provide safe, controlable and distributed heating around the waist band. We developed a bluetooth controlled heating system and an android app to achieve this.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="caption-11" style="display:none;">
		
		<p>Control module is powered by a 2200mAh LiPo battery that can power the system with intermittent usage for 8-10 hours which represents a typical work day for majority of our audiance.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="caption-12" style="display:none;">
		<p>Based on the set temperature, Control module regulated the heating of 3 discrete temp. control zones of the heat pad. The system is incooperated with multiple safety features to safeguard against any possible malfunction of the system..</p>
