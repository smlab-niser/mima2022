## Multifunctional IoT integrated Menstrual Aid

Joint work with NIFT, Bhubaneswar. 

Abstract: 
Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium lining of a woman's uterus. The average age when girls start menstruating is around the age of 12 years (menarche), and the cycle continues until they attain menopause (about the age of 51). Medical research and analysis in this field reveal that most women have to go through a painful cycle of abdominal cramps along with sanitary pad rashes while painkillers or endurance ability is their go-to solution. Heat pads or hot water bags also help in pain reduction. Currently, the concept of period pants revolves around pad-free and hassle-free periods for women whereas most women still prefer sanitary pads during their period cycle. 
MIMA aims at the development of IoT integrated smart functional intimate wear for women that would help women comfort during menstruation by catering to issues of menstrual cramps, rashes, leakage and stains, malodor, etc. The proposed methodology has been implemented referring to the online survey conducted from Indian women (17- 58 years old). The proposed intimate wear- MIMA can provide comfort during the menstruation cycle with IoT integrated Heat-Pad and functional alterations in the garment for a rash-free, anti-odor, and leak-proof period.
